    <h2>What is Switchfoot?</h2>
   
    <p>
        Switchfoot is an American rock band that has been making creative, positive, and thought provocing music since 1996. The name "Switchfoot" came from a surfing term. Founding member Jon Foreman explanes, "We all love to surf and have been surfing all our lives so to us, the name made sense. To switch your feet means to take a new stance facing the opposite direction. It's about change and movement, a different way of approaching life and music."
